Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).\\n\\nI declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\\nto US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as \"Precious Stones and Jewellry\" in other that its\\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \\n\\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\\n\\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries\" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \\n\\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\\n\\nExpecting your response urgently.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nMr. Ben Suleman\\n\\nFrom r  Thu Oct 31 17:27:16 2002\\nReturn-Path: <obong_715@epatra.com>\\nX-Sieve: cmu-sieve 2.0\\nReturn-Path: <obong_715@epatra.com>\\nMessage-Id: <200210312227.g9VMQvDj017948@bluewhale.cs.CU>\\nFrom: \"PRINCE OBONG ELEME\" <obong_715@epatra.com>\\nReply-To: obong_715@epatra.com\\nTo: webmaster@aclweb.org\\nDate: Thu, 31 Oct 2002 22:17:55 +0100\\nSubject: GOOD DAY TO YOU\\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.00.2919.6900DM\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\\nX-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by sideshowmel.si.UM id g9VMRBW20642\\nStatus: RO\\n\\nFROM HIS ROYAL MAJESTY (HRM) CROWN RULER OF ELEME KINGDOM \\nCHIEF DANIEL ELEME, PHD, EZE 1 OF ELEME.E-MAIL \\nADDRESS:obong_715@epatra.com  \\n\\nATTENTION:PRESIDENT,CEO Sir/ Madam. \\n\\nThis letter might surprise you because we have met\\nneither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe\\nit is one day that you got to know somebody either in\\nphysical or through correspondence. \\n\\nI got your contact through discreet inquiry from the\\nchambers of commerce and industry of your country on\\nthe net, you and your organization were revealed as\\nbeing quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one\\nhas no doubt in your ability to handle a financialbusiness transaction. \\n\\nHowever, I am the first son of His Royal\\nmajesty,Obong.D. Eleme , and the traditional Ruler of\\nEleme Province in the oil producing area of River\\nState of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in\\nrespect of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United\\nState Dollars), which I inherited, from my latefather. \\n\\nThis money was accumulated from royalties paid to my\\nfather as compensation by the oil firms located in our\\narea as a result of oil presence on our land, which\\nhamper agriculture, which is our major source oflivelihood. \\n\\nUnfortunately my father died from protracted\\ndiabetes.But before his death he called my attention\\nand informed me that he lodged some funds on a two\\nboxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary\\nstatus. The lodgment security code number was also\\nrevealed to me, he then advised me to look for a\\nreliable business partner abroad, that will assist me\\nin investing the money in a lucrative business as a\\nresult of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is\\nthe main reason why I am contacting you for us to move\\nthis money from the security firm to any Country of\\nyour choice for investment purpose. \\n\\nSo I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so\\nthat the funds can be moved in your name and\\nparticulars to any Country of your choice where it\\nwill be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had\\nintimated the security firm personnel that the\\nbeneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose\\nparticulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. \\n\\nBut I will guide you Accordingly. As soon as the funds\\nreach, I will then come over to meet you in person, so\\nthat we can discuss physically on investment\\npotentials. Based on this assistance my Family and I\\nhave unanimously decided to give you 30% of the total\\nmoney, 5% for Charity home, 10% for expenses, which\\nmay arise during this transaction, Fax and phone bills\\ninclusive. The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. \\n\\nI hereby guarantee you that this is not government\\nmoney, it is not drug money and it is not money from\\narms deal. Though you have to maintain high degree of\\nconfidentiality on this matter. I will give more\\ndetails about the proceedings of this transaction as\\nsoon as I receive your favorable reply. \\n\\nPlease reply to my Email Address:obong_715@epatra.com\\nI hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous\\nrelationship between my family and your family. \\n\\nNevertheless if you are for any reason not interested,\\nkindly inform me immediately so that I will look foranother contact. \\n\\nI am waiting for your quick response. \\n\\nYours faithfully, \\n\\nPrince Obong Abbot \\n'"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}],"metadata":{},"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aUg8HenSBLG2","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### 讀取寄件者資訊\n","觀察文本資料可以發現, 寄件者資訊都符合以下格式\n","\n","`From: <收件者姓名> <收件者電子郵件>`"]},{"source":["#<your code>#\n","# 取得FROM後面的任何字串\n","# *任何字母(數字+符號)\n","pattern = r'From:.*'\n","match = re.findall(pattern, sample_corpus)"],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{},"execution_count":48},{"source":["match"],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"['From: \"MR.

The rea=\\nson for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human priv=\\nileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned o=\\nf the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing ba=\\nsed on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my=\\n extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assistin=\\ng me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the=\\n auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L\\'=\\nInustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard.=20\\n=20\\nI have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very b=\\neneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investiga=\\ntion and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum o=\\nf money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horri=\\nfic Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- ce=\\nntury tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia.=20\\n=20\\n>From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed h=\\nim with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The pe=\\nrson that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who =\\ndied along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this in=\\nformation secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and id=\\nea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amou=\\nnt was (US$11.4M).=20\\n=20\\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bona=\\nfide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer th=\\nis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and need=\\ned information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest=\\n and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great busi=\\nness opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this de=\\nal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we =\\nare not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an e=\\nye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.=\\n=20\\n=20\\nThis is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who =\\nwill forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to t=\\nhe Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to b=\\ne re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification a=\\nnd clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole mo=\\nney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.=20\\n=20\\nMay I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I =\\nhave made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smoo=\\nth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total=\\n sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses =\\nthat may arise during the time of transfer processing and also telephone bi=\\nlls, while 65% will be for me and my partner.=20\\n=20\\nPlease, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service=\\n and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my departm=\\nent came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr =\\nWahid Yoffe who died in the horrific Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that =\\nhas killed more than all 20th- century tsunamis combined that happened in S=\\numatra island, Indonesia. </DIV>\\n<DIV style=3D\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold\">&nbsp;</DIV>\\n<DIV style=3D\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold\">From the information that our bank have go=\\ntten so far, the Tsunami killed him with his entire family and no none rela=\\ntion have been identified.

The money is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am currently in exile  after the death of president Kabila.\\n\\nI need a reliable and trust worthy foreign partner/national who can assist me to clear and move this money as the beneficiary from the security company.\\n\\nThough we have not seen nor met each other, but I would want this transaction to be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks, this money in question is state fund as it is a deal between you and I, hence the need for secrecy considering the security implications.\\n\\n\\nThus, if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of the Netherlands, you can contact  me onthe above email addres to enable us discuss more about the deal and what  your percentage will be for assisting me.\\n\\nPlease note that you will be required to make a brief trip to the Netherlands for inspection of the fund. I also intend to visit your country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment.\\n\\nI shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.\\n\\nKindest  Regards,\\n\\nCOL. Victor Aloma\\n\\n'}"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":64}],"metadata":{},"execution_count":64},{"source":["#將處理結果轉化為dataframe\n","emails_df = pd.DataFrame(emails_list)\n","emails_df"],"cell_type":"code","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                     sender_email             sender_name  \\\n0     james_ngola2002@maktoob.com        MR.
